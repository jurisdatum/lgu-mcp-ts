export const description = `Semantic search across legislation sections using a vector index.

Returns individual sections ranked by relevance to your query, including the actual section text.

IMPORTANT: This tool searches a pre-computed vector index that may not reflect the most recent legislation.
The index is a snapshot and may be days or weeks behind the live legislation.gov.uk dataset. For critical
research or to ensure you have the latest amendments, verify results against search_legislation or the
live website.

Returned fields:
- provisionId: Section identifier
- provisionType: Section type (e.g., "section", "regulation")
- number: Section number
- legislation: Parent legislation object with id (e.g., "ukpga/2018/12"), type, year, number
- text: Section text (unless includeText=false)
- extent: Geographical extent codes (e.g., ["E", "W"] for England and Wales)

Usage:
- Call with a query to find relevant sections across all legislation
- Use includeText=true to retrieve the actual section text (slower)

Notes:
- Does not include Act title, but provides legislation identifier (e.g., "ukpga/2018/12") which can be used directly with get_legislation_metadata to retrieve title and other details.
- Year filters (yearFrom/yearTo) do not work reliably for regnal-year legislation.`;
